                graphs G having a facial 2-factor Q . Thus hamiltonicity in G is
                transformed into the existence of a (quasi) spanning tree of
                faces in the contraction G ‚àï Q . In particular, we study the case
                where G is the leapfrog extension (called vertex envelope of a

                in the leapfrog extension of planar cubic cyclically

    author = "Brinkmann, Gunnar and Goedgebeur, Jan and McKay, Brendan",
    abstract = "In 1971, Tutte wrote in an article that ``it is tempting to
                conjecture that every 3-connected bipartite cubic graph is
                hamiltonian''. Motivated by this remark, Horton constructed a
                counterexample on 96 vertices. In a sequence of articles by
                different authors several smaller counterexamples were presented.
                The smallest of these graphs is a graph on 50 vertices which was
                discovered independently by Georges and Kelmans. In this article
                we show that there is no smaller counterexample. As all
                non-hamiltonian 3-connected bipartite cubic graphs in the
                literature have cyclic 4-cuts -- even if they have girth 6 -- it
                is natural to ask whether this is a necessary prerequisite. In
                this article we answer this question in the negative and give a
                construction of an infinite family of non-hamiltonian cyclically
                5-connected bipartite cubic graphs. In 1969, Barnette gave a
                weaker version of the conjecture stating that 3-connected planar
                bipartite cubic graphs are hamiltonian. We show that Barnette's
                conjecture is true up to at least 90 vertices. We also report
                that a search of small non-hamiltonian 3-connected bipartite
                cubic graphs did not find any with genus less than 4.",
