\section{Field Extensions}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:field extension degrees multiply}
    If $F\to K$ and $K\to L$ are finite, then $[L:F]=[L:K][K:L]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\}$ and $\{\beta_1,\dots,\beta_m\}$ be bases for $F\to K$ and $K\to L$
    respectively.
    We claim $S=\{\alpha_i\beta_j\}$ is an $F$-basis for $L$.
    It is immediate that $S$ spans $L$, so we show that $S$ is linearly independent.

    Suppose some linear combination of $S$ is zero, then factoring out by the $\alpha_i$ implies the coefficients of
    each group of $\alpha_i$ must be zero, but they are all linear combinations of the $\beta_j$, hence all
    coefficients must be zero.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    A field extension is finite if and only if it is algebraic and finitely generated.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $F\to K$ is a field extension.
    It is trivial to show that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item if $F\to K$ is not algebraic, then it is not finite, and
        \item if $F\to K$ is not finitely generated, then it is not finite.
    \end{enumerate}

    Suppose $F\to K$ is algebraic and finitely generated, and let $\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\}$ be a basis for
    $F\to K$.
    Break the extension down by $F\to F(\alpha_1)\to F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)\to\dots\to F(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)=K$, and
    see that each of these intermediate extensions are finite.
    Theorem $\ref{thm:field extension degrees multiply}$ asserts $F\to K$ is finite.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    Every composition of algebraic field extensions is algebraic.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $F\to K$ and $K\to L$ are algebraic.
    Let $\alpha\in L$ with $m_{\alpha,K}=x^n+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+c_0$, and construct $K^\prime=F(c_0,\dots,c_{n-1})$,
    which is algebraic and finitely generated, hence finite.
    But $K^\prime\to K^\prime(\alpha)$ is also finite, so $F\to K^\prime(\alpha)$ is finite, therefore $\alpha$ is
    algebraic over $F$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Kronecker]
    \label{thm:kronecker}
    If $F$ is a field and $f\in F[x]$ is non-constant, then there exists a finite $F\to K$ such that $f$ has a root in
    $K$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Without loss of generality, we may assume $f$ is irreducible.
    Define $K=F[x]/\langle f\rangle$, which is a field because $\langle f\rangle$ is maximal.
    See that $x+\langle f\rangle\in K$ is a root of $f$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    A field $F$ is algebraically closed if and only if every algebraic $F\to K$ has $[K:F]=1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The ``only if'' is trivial, so suppose every $F\to K$ has $[K:F]=1$.
    Let $f\in F[x]$, and Theorem \ref{thm:kronecker} asserts there exists a finite $F\to K$ in which $f$ has a root.
    But $[K:F]=1$, so this root is in fact in $F$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Every field has an algebraic closure.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $F$ is a field, and define $S$ to be the set of monic and irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$.
    Also construct $R=F[y_f\mid f\in S]$ and $I=\langle f(y_f)\mid f\in S\rangle$.

    We claim $1\notin I$.
    Towards a contradiction, suppose $1\in I$, so we can write $1=\sum_ia_if_i(y_{f_i})$ for $a_i\in R$ and $f_i\in S$.
    Repeating Theorem \ref{thm:kronecker} for each $f_i$ generates a field extension in which there exist $\alpha_i$
    such that $f_i(\alpha_i)=0$ for all $i$, but now we have $1=\sum_ia_if_i(\alpha_i)=0$, a contradiction.

    Now we know $I$ is a proper ideal, so it is contained in some maximal ideal $M$.
    Define $F\to K=R/M$, and see that $y_i+\langle M\rangle\in K$ is a root of $f_i$, so we conclude that $K$ is an
    algebraic closure of $F$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Isomorphism Extension]
    Let $F$ and $K$ be fields with isomorphism $\phi:F\to K$.
    If $F\to E$ is algebraic, then there exists an isomorphism $\psi$ between $E$ and a subfield of $\overline{K}$
    satisfying $\psi\vert_F=\phi$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $S$ be the set of $(E^\prime,\sigma)$ where $E^\prime$ is a field satisfying $F\subseteq E^\prime\subseteq E$
    and $\sigma$ an isomorphism from $E^\prime$ to a subfield of $\overline{K}$ satisfying $\sigma\vert_F=\phi$.
    Define a partial order on $S$ by $(E_1,\sigma_1)\leq (E_2,\sigma_2)$ if and only if $E_1\subseteq E_2$ and
    $\sigma_2\vert_{E_1}=\sigma_1$.
    We wish to apply Zorn's Lemma to $S$, so we note
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item that $(F,\phi)\in S$ implies $S$ is non-empty, and

        \item
            that every chain $(E_1,\sigma_1)\leq(E_2,\sigma_2)\leq\dots$ in $S$ is bounded above by
            $(E^\prime,\sigma)$, where $E^\prime=\bigcup_iE_i$ and $\sigma$ is defined by simply using whichever
            $\sigma_i$ is available, since they are all compatible.
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore, there exists a maximal element $(M,\tau)\in S$, and we want to show $M=E$.
    Towards a contradiction, suppose $M\subsetneq E$ and choose $\alpha\in E\setminus M$ with minimal polynomial
    $m_{\alpha,M}=x^n+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+c_0\in M[x]$.
    Define $L=\tau(M)$ and $f(x)=x^n+\tau(c_{n-1})x^{n-1}+\dots+\tau(c_0)\in L[x]$, and see that
    \[M(\alpha)\to M[x]/m_{\alpha,M}\to L[x]/f(x)\to L(\beta)\]
    is an isomorphism for $\beta\in\overline{L}=\overline{K}$ a root of $f(x)$.
    Moreover, this extends $\tau$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    If $F$ is a field, then all algebraic closures of $F$ are pairwise isomorphic.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Symmetric Polynomials]
    Every symmetric polynomial can be written uniquely as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Algebra]
    The set of complex numbers is algebraically closed.
